- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zippo269
- 👀 I’m interested in someday being skilled enough to earn the title of full stack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics through tutorials and through the mimo application on my phone.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone that would be willing to give me advice or anything that helped them progress in the field or helped ease day to day scripting activies.
- 📫 How to reach me~ you could reach me via email initially, or on my linkedIn account @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-anderson-409523219/
